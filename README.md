# Mylyn-for-atom

Task focused development in Atom, based on Mylyn for Eclipse. Mylyn filters the tree view so only files related to a specific task is shown. Files will be automatically removed from the view when not used for a longer period.

## Usage
Enable Mylyn through command pallete  (mylyn:toggle-enabled)

Add a task, or tasks  (mylyn:new-task)

Start working..select files either through ctrl-p or by switching off filtering  (mylyn:toggle-filter), then add files using the file tree view.


When you have the files you need, toogle filter again.

Tasks will be automatically saved when you exit Atom (to ~/.config/mylyn.json)
